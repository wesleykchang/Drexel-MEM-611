    "# Session 1: Introduction to Conductive Heat Transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prelude\n",
    "\n",
    "What do we want to learn in this class? \n",
    "- Heat transfer, but also: why heat transfer could be important to your graduate research, and what are some key practical takeaways for your research and future career aspirations \n",
    "- Conventionally: concepts, with a lot of math. Math is hard. Therefore, we'll use Python to do the legwork for us. Also, concepts can be nebulous. We'll use Python to visualize things and practical demos/projects to illustrate and test our understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "What is heat transfer? **Heat transfer is thermal energy in transit due to a spatial temperature difference** \n",
    "\n",
    "What is conduction? **Heat transfer that occurs across a medium**\n",
    "- Temperature is generally associated with the energy of gas molecules in proximity to a reference point, and is related to both random translational motion and internal rotational and vibrational motions of molecules\n",
    "- However, engineers don't really care about every single molecular action. We work with practical devices like batteries, automobiles and HVAC systems, so generally we assume a macroscopic average. "
