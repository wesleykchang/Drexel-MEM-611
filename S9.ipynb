    "Three modes of heat transfer\n",
    "- Conduction: process of heat transfer by molecular motion, along with flow of free electrons and lattice vibrations from regions of high temperature to regions of low temperature\n",
    "- Convection: process of heat transfer by movement of fluid \n",
    "- Radiation: process of heat transfer in the form of electromagnetic waves (i.e. materials emit radiation as a result of their temperature)\n",
    "*in practice, heat transfer occurs by a combination of all 3, but for simplicity we focus on each aspect separately \n",
    "\n",
    "What is conduction? **Heat transfer that occurs across a medium**\n",
    "- Temperature is generally associated with the energy of gas molecules in proximity to a reference point, and is related to both random translational motion and internal rotational and vibrational motions of molecules\n",

    "**therefore, heat flow is constant if the two surface temperatures in a 1D steady state system (without any internal energy) is constant**\n",

    "Empirically, q is found to be directly proportional to surface area A and the temperature difference (T1 - T2), and inversely proportional to thickness L: $$ q \\sim A*\\frac{T1 - T2}{L} $$, or the instantaneous temperature change: $$ q = -kA \\frac{dT}{dx} $$, which is Fourier's Law of Heat Conduction for a one-dimensional system. \n",
